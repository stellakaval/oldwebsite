      <dt><h4>About</h4></dt>
      <dd><p>In Ants vs. Bees, I created a computer game where players take on the role of an ant queen and must defend their colony from invading bees. To do this, the player must carefully choose which types of ants to place in the colony, as each type has a different ability or action it can perform. The player must also deal with bees, which move through the colony and try to reach the end of the tunnel. The game is won by defeating all of the bees, and it is lost if a bee reaches the end of the tunnel or if the bees destroy the QueenAnt. The game takes place in a series of turns, during which the player can place new ants and the insects (ants and bees) take their actions.</p></dd>
      <dt><h4>Skills</h4></dt>
      <dd><p>To create this project, I focused on using an object-oriented programming paradigm and worked with several core classes, including GameState, Place, Hive, AntHomeBase, Insect, Ant, and Bee. I implemented various ant types, including HarvesterAnts and ThrowerAnts, and created a system for bees to move through the tunnel and attack ants. I also had to consider concepts such as health, food costs, and turn order to make the game functioning properly.</p></dd>
