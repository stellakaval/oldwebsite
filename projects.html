      <dt><h4>About</h4></dt>
      <dd><p>Gitlet is a version control system that allows you to save, restore, and view the history of your project, as well as maintain and switch between different versions of your files. It is a simpler and smaller version of the popular version control system Git.</p></dd>
      <dt><h4>Skills</h4></dt>
      <dd><p>I gained experience with file manipulation, serialization techniques, and working with complex data structures such as linked lists. I also learned about version control systems and how they are used to track changes to files and projects. I had the opportunity to replicate key features of a version control system, such as adding, committing, removing, branching, and merging changes. These skills required me to practice debugging and problem-solving as I worked through the challenges of implementing these features. Additionally, I had to create a design document outlining the overall architecture and design of my implementation, as well as unit tests to ensure that my code was correct and reliable.</p></dd>

    <h3>Enigma</h3>

      <dt><h4>Language</h4></dt>
      <dd><p><img src="javalogo.png" alt="java logo" width=60></p></dd>
      <dt><h4>About</h4></dt>
      <dd><p>I worked on a project where I created a simulation of the Enigma machine in Java. The Enigma machine was a mechanical device used to encrypt and decrypt messages during World War II, and my program allowed users to input messages and configure the machine with different rotors and reflectors in order to encrypt and decrypt those messages. I implemented a series of rotors and a reflector to create a progressive substitution cipher, using a one-to-one mapping of the alphabet onto itself to replace each letter in the message with another letter based on the current configuration of the machine.</p></dd>
      <dt><h4>Skills</h4></dt>
      <dd><p>While working on this project, I developed my programming skills in several areas. I implemented the Enigma machine's substitution cipher algorithm using arrays and lists to store and manipulate the rotors and reflectors. I also designed and implemented classes to represent the different components of the Enigma machine, including the rotors, reflector, and Enigma machine itself. These classes used object-oriented programming techniques, such as encapsulation and inheritance, to represent the relationships between the different components and to allow for reuse and customization of the Enigma machine's functionality.</p></dd>

    <h3>Ataxx</h3>

      <dd><p><img src="javalogo.png" alt="java logo" width=60></p></dd>
      <dt><h4>About</h4></dt>
      <dd><p>Attax is a board game played on a 7x7 grid with red and blue pieces. Players can either extend their own pieces by placing a new piece next to an existing one, or jump to an empty square that is no more than two rows and columns away. The goal is to have the most pieces on the board when no more moves are possible or after 25 jumps with no intervening extends. Players can also place blocks on the board to restrict movement. The winner is the player with the most pieces at the end of the game.</p></dd>
      <dt><h4>Skills</h4></dt>
      <dd><p>While working on the Attax project, I learned how to implement and use various data structures such as lists, dictionaries, and sets. I also practiced using control statements such as if-else statements and while loops to execute different actions based on certain conditions. Additionally, I learned how to design and implement an automated player using artificial intelligence techniques such as minimax and alpha-beta pruning. I also gained experience in creating a GUI interface for the game and handling user input.</p></dd>

    <h3>Scheme Interpreter</h3>

      <dd><p><img src="python.png" alt="Python logo" width=70></p></dd>
      <dt><h4>About</h4></dt>
      <dd><p>The Scheme Interpreter project involves creating an interpreter for a subset of the Scheme programming language. The project involves implementing the evaluation and application of Scheme expressions, as well as handling special forms and creating classes to describe Scheme expressions.</p></dd>
      <dt><h4>Skills</h4></dt>
      <dd><p>I learned how to implement the evaluation and application of Scheme expressions, as well as handle special forms and create classes to describe Scheme expressions. I also had the opportunity to practice debugging and testing my code using the "ok" autograder. Additionally, I gained experience with designing and implementing an interpreter for a programming language. I had to think about the issues that arise in the design of a programming language and consider how they can impact the implementation of an interpreter.</p></dd>

    <h3>Ants vs. Bees</h3>
    <img class="project-images" src="antsandbees.png" alt="Ants vs. Bees Project Cover" width=400>
    <dl>
      <dt><h4>Language</h4></dt>
      <dd><p><img src="python.png" alt="Python logo" width=70></p></dd>
      <dt><h4>About</h4></dt>
      <dd><p>In Ants vs. Bees, I created a computer game where players take on the role of an ant queen and must defend their colony from invading bees. To do this, the player must carefully choose which types of ants to place in the colony, as each type has a different ability or action it can perform. The player must also deal with bees, which move through the colony and try to reach the end of the tunnel. The game is won by defeating all of the bees, and it is lost if a bee reaches the end of the tunnel or if the bees destroy the QueenAnt. The game takes place in a series of turns, during which the player can place new ants and the insects (ants and bees) take their actions.</p></dd>
      <dt><h4>Skills</h4></dt>
      <dd><p>To create this project, I focused on using an object-oriented programming paradigm and worked with several core classes, including GameState, Place, Hive, AntHomeBase, Insect, Ant, and Bee. I implemented various ant types, including HarvesterAnts and ThrowerAnts, and created a system for bees to move through the tunnel and attack ants. I also had to consider concepts such as health, food costs, and turn order to make the game functioning properly.</p></dd>

    <h3>Hog</h3>

      <dd><p><img src="python.png" alt="Python logo" width=70></p></dd>
      <dt><h4>About</h4></dt>
      <dd><p>The purpose of the Hog project is to create a simulator and strategies for a dice game called Hog. Players take turns rolling dice and trying to be the first to reach a certain number of points. There are special rules for rolling zero dice and reaching perfect square scores.</p></dd>
      <dt><h4>Skills</h4></dt>
      <dd><p>By completing the Hog project, I learned several programming skills in Python, including how to use control statements and higher-order functions. I also learned how to design and implement a simulation for a dice game. I practiced debugging and testing my code using the "ok" autograder. I also had the opportunity to work with a partner, which allowed me to practice teamwork and collaboration skills.</p></dd>

    <h3>Cats</h3>

      <dt><h4>Language</h4></dt>
      <dd><p><img src="python.png" alt="Python logo" width=70></p></dd>
      <dt><h4>About</h4></dt>
      <dd><p>The goal of this project was to create a program that can measure typing speed and correct spelling errors. I wrote code in Python and edited a file "cats.py" file. The project included text samples to be typed and a web server for a graphical user interface, provided by UC Berkeley’s CS61A course staff.</p></dd>
      <dt><h4>Skills</h4></dt>
      <dd><p>I worked with files and strings, so I needed to know how to read and write to files and manipulate strings. As I worked on the project, I ran into bugs and errors, so it was important for me to know how to debug my code. It was also crucial for me to test my code frequently to make sure everything was working correctly. I used the "ok" autograder to test my code and track my progress as I worked on the project.</p></dd>
