      <p class="bigger-text"> My name is Stella Kaval and I'm a 2nd year Computer Science major at <a href="https://cs.berkeley.edu/">UC Berkeley</a>. This summer, I will be joining <a href="https://www.oracle.com/cloud/">Oracle</a> in Redwood City, CA as a Software Engineering Intern in Oracle Cloud Platforms! While I'm not in class or coding away, you can find me catching up on the latest season of Survivor, hitting the golf course, learning Swedish, going to concerts, or sipping on iced coffees.</p>

      <p class="bigger-text">One of the things I'm most passionate about is teaching and sharing my knowledge with others. I've had the chance to do this as a TA for CS61B, a programming instructor at Code for Fun and a math tutor at Mathnasium. I've also taken action on narrowing the CS gender gap through <a href="./csk.html">CS Kickstart</a>, where I organized and executed an annual introductory CS program for 100+ female-identifying students.</p>

      <p class="bigger-text">I've also worked on a number of <a href="./projects">personal projects</a>, which have helped me continue learning and improving my skills. I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow, both personally and professionally. I'm passionate about using my skills and knowledge to make a positive impact in the world and I'm excited to see what the future holds!</p>
