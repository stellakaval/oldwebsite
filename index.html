    <p>Hi there! My name is Stella Kaval and I'm currently studying computer science at <a href="https://cs.berkeley.edu/">UC Berkeley</a>. I've always been passionate about technology and have loved diving into the world of programming. My coursework at Berkeley has given me a solid foundation in computer science, including classes like Data Structures, Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, and Foundations of Data Science. I've also had the opportunity to apply my skills in real-world settings through internships at the UC Berkeley <a href="https://data.berkeley.edu/discovery">Data Science Discovery</a> Program and <a href="https://girlslearn.org/">Girls Learn International</a> Nonprofit. This summer, I will be joining <a href="https://www.oracle.com/cloud/">Oracle</a> in Redwood City, CA as a Software Engineering Intern in Oracle Cloud Platforms.</p>
    <p>One of the things I'm most passionate about is teaching and sharing my knowledge with others. I've had the chance to do this as a programming instructor and a math tutor, and I've really enjoyed being able to help students understand complex concepts and see their progress. I've also had the opportunity to take on a leadership role as the Lead Director of <a href="./csk.html">CS Kickstart</a>, where I organized and executed an annual introductory CS program for 100+ female-identifying students at UC Berkeley.
    </p>
    <p>I've also worked on a number of <a href="./projects">personal projects</a>, like a version-control system in Java and a Scheme Interpreter in Python, which have helped me continue learning and improving my skills. I'm always looking for new opportunities to learn and grow, both personally and professionally. I'm passionate about using my skills and knowledge to make a positive impact in the world and I'm excited to see what the future holds!</p>
