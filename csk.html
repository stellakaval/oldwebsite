    <h2>About CS Kickstart</h2>
    <p>As the Lead Director of <a href="https://cs-kickstart.berkeley.edu/">CS KickStart</a>, I have had the opportunity to play a key role in providing incoming women at the University of California, Berkeley with the opportunity to learn about computer science and get a taste of life at Berkeley. <b>CS KickStart is a one-week introductory course for incoming female-identifying freshmen who are interested in math, science, or engineering, and it exists to help address the gender gap in computer science.</b> Over 100 participants are able to take part in the program each year, and it is offered free of charge to students.</p>
    <p>During the program, I have helped students acquire basic programming skills through programming labs and have supported them in exploring the various domains of computer science through talks and lectures. I have also helped to create a welcoming and supportive environment for participants by living with them in the freshman dorms as an RA and leading social activities to help them build a network of peers. Alumnae working in industry and academia have visited the program to share their experiences as computer scientists, and current undergraduates have led mentoring sessions to help participants learn more about life at Berkeley. In addition, I have organized field trips to one or more Silicon Valley companies, including Microsoft, SAP, DoorDash, and Stitch Fix, to explore work environments for computer scientists and provide students with a glimpse into the possibilities available to them in the field.</p>
    <p>Overall, my personal involvement in the CS KickStart program has allowed me to make a positive impact on the lives of incoming women at UC Berkeley and to help them get a head start on their studies. I have loved my experience as a Lead Director and am excited to continue supporting students as they begin their studies at UC Berkeley and explore the possibilities available to them in the field of computer science!
